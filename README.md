# Project Tech 

## Dating app feature

For my feature I chose the following job story:

_**When** I see someones profile **I want to** see if we listen to the same kind of music **so I can** see if we have the same taste in music._

For my feature users can add songs to their playlist with a form and these songs will be displayed on their playlist. 
When searching for matches users can look into each other's and the songs that match are highlighted in green.
